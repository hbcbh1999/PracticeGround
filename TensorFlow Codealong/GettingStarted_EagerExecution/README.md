[https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/eager]  
TensorFlow's site has many useful tutorials and code examples.  
Going through the documentation and trying the code will be really helpful.  
I got started with Eager Execution example.   
TensorFlow has recently added eager execution which provides immediate evaluation unlike the earlier computation graph execution.
